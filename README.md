# Q-learning
Using reinforcement learning to play snake.

An environment is created that simulates a snake game . This environment takes actions and returns the resulting screen of those actions, plus the resulting reward (-1 if the snake dies, 0 if nothing happens and 1 if the snake eats a fruit).

A player with a neural-network provides actions and learns from the environment responses using Q-learning.
